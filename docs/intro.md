# Project Setup Guide


## Getting Started


Follow this link to my github to download the project **[Github](https://github.com/Soma586)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.


## Start my Cypto Tracker project

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run dev
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run dev` command builds my website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
