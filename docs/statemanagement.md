# State Management


## Why I chose React Query over  Zustand  and Context API


After some research React query turn out to be a better option for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.

Key Features:

- Automatic caching and background refetching.
- Built-in loading and error states.
- Deduplication of requests (avoids duplicate API calls).
- Optimistic updates and pagination support.
- Devtools for debugging.

Use Case: Ideal for managing server state (e.g., API data).


Zustand and the Context API are better suited for global state management and sharing data across components. However, for a simple single-page app like tracking cryptocurrency prices, they werenâ€™t really necessary. That said, if we were to expand the app to handle features like user authentication or sharing data across different pages in a more robust website, Zustand or the Context API would become much more relevant and useful.
