# Challenges & solutions


## Using React Query and Shadcn/tailwind

I had never gotten the chance to use React Query before, but after taking the time to learn it, it has opened my eyes to the potential of using this library more in the future. It provides an awesome solution for better control over when you fetch API data and how you handle errors. It’s something I will definitely see myself using in current and future projects from now on.

Shadcn is a component library I decided to use because it provides beautiful, customizable components that fit well with my project needs. I thought it would be a great addition to the project, and it has proven to be just that.

I’ve always preferred CSS/SCSS for styling, but Tailwind CSS has opened my perspective. I recently learned that Tailwind can also be used in React Native, which is exciting! I’m currently working on a mobile app project for a client, and I’m considering learning Tailwind to speed up the styling process and deliver results faster.
